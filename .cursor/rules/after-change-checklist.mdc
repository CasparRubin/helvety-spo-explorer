# After-Change Checklist

After implementing or changing code, also do the following:

## Tests

- Add or update unit/integration tests for new or changed behavior.
- Keep test structure and coverage in line with the project.

## Comments / JSDoc

- Update or add JSDoc/comments where behavior or public API changes.

## README

- Update `README.md` (and any app-specific docs) when setup, scripts, environment, or the surface area of the app changes.

## Legal / static docs

- If the change affects data handling, product behavior, or user-facing terms, consider updating any legal or static documentation in the repo.
