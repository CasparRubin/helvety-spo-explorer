# Official Documentation First

When implementing or altering code that touches a framework, library, or service:

1. Consult **official vendor documentation** first.
2. Prefer current, vendor-recommended APIs and patterns.
3. Avoid deprecated APIs.
4. Do **not** rely on third-party blog posts or tutorials as the primary source.

## This repo (SPFx)

Use official docs for:

- [SharePoint Framework (SPFx)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/sharepoint-framework-overview)
- [Fluent UI React](https://react.fluentui.dev)
- Build tooling (e.g. Heft, Rushstack) as applicable
