# SPFx / helvety-spo-explorer Stack

This repo is **SharePoint Framework (SPFx)** with Heft and Fluent UI. Structure and patterns follow SPFx/Heft conventions, not the Next.js layout used in other Helvety apps.

- For patterns and best practices, use official **Microsoft SPFx** and **Fluent UI** documentation.
- Do not apply Next.js-specific rules (e.g. App Router, server actions) here.
